# Model Citizen

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

Model Citizen is an annotation based model factory for Java, inspired by [factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot)

A Model is mapped by a _@Blueprint_ using annotated fields. Blueprints contain
default values and references to other @Blueprinted models. The _ModelFactory_ can
create models based on registered blueprints. A model already created can be
passed into the _ModelFactory_ as a reference model, which will be used as the basis
for the new Model.

## Blueprint

A blueprint is a Class annotated with _@Blueprint( Class )_ and contains annotated fields. Everything else is ignored by the _ModelFactory_.
Model Citizen [own blueprints](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/tree/master/core/src/test/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/blueprint) are a great example of how they work.

**@Blueprint**: Class annotation
   * _value_: [Class] The target model class for this blueprint.
   * _template_: [Class] The [template](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/template/BlueprintTemplate.java) use to construct and inject the model. Defaults to [JavaBeanTemplate](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/template/JavaBeanTemplate.java)


### Field Annotations
**@Default**: The default value for the field.
   * _force_:  [boolean] Force the value of the Default to always be set, even if the target field already has a value. Default is false. This is useful for overriding primatives or Collections.

**@Mapped**: The value is mapped to another @Blueprint, default is the blueprint for
               matching field's Class. Mapped class can be set by the _target_ param.

**@MappedList**: Creates a List of Models mapped to another blueprint.
  * _size_: [int] Number of Models to be created by the ModelFactory and added to List, defaults to 1.
  * _target_: [Class] The target Blueprint Class used to create Models
  * _targetList_: [Class] The List created, defaults to ArrayList
  * _ignoreEmpty_: [boolean] If true, do not create Models for an empty Set. Defaults to true.
  * _force_: [boolean] Force the value of the MappedList to always be set, even if the target field already has a value. Default is false.

**@MappedSet**: Creates a Set of Models mapped to another blueprint.
  * _size_: [int] Number of Models to be created by the ModelFactory and added to Set, defaults to 1.
  * _target_: [Class] The target Blueprint Class used to create Models
  * _targetSet_: [Class] The Set created, defaults to HashSet
  * _ignoreEmpty_: [boolean] If true, do not create Models for an empty Set. Defaults to true.
  * _force_:  [boolean] Force the value of the MappedSet to always be set, even if the target field already has a value. Default is false.

**@Nullable**: Specifies this field can be null and not to set a value by the ModelFactory.

### Callbacks

Callback fields can be used to inject values at the various stages of the model creation lifecycle:

**ConstructorCallback**: Use when constructing a new instance of the model, the model return by the callback is used by the ModelFactory. ([example blueprint](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/core/src/test/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/blueprint/SpareTireBlueprint.java)).

**FieldCallback**: Injects the return of the callback for the annotated field value ([example blueprint](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/core/src/test/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/blueprint/UserBlueprint.java)).

**AfterCreateCallback**: Executed after the model has been constructed and all the fields are set ([example blueprint](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/core/src/test/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/blueprint/SpareTireBlueprint.java)).

### Inheritance

A Blueprint will inherit the fields of its parent, except for `ConstructorCallback`.

## Model

Presently only supports [template for JavaBean Models](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/template/JavaBeanTemplate.java).
For annotations to work with the template, the model must follow the [JavaBean](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Beans) getter and setters
for fields.

### Working with primitives

[Primitive fields are intialized as zero](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.5) and
will never be null. This will cause the _ModelFactory_ to think that a value has already been assigned to the model and
not assign one from the blueprint. To work around this, use the `force=true` in the blueprint to force that value is always assigned from the blueprint, for example:

    @Blueprint(Car.class)
    public class CarBlueprint {

    @Default(force=true)
    float mileage = 100.1f;

## ModelFactory

Creates new instances of Models based on registered Blueprints. It is possible to
[register Blueprints by package](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/wiki/Register-By-Package).

A new instance is always constructed, unless specified by a
[Policy](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/wiki/Policy).

Example of creating a new _ModelFactory_ and registering the _CarBlueprint_

    ModelFactory modelFactory = new ModelFactory();
    modelFactory.registerBlueprint( CarBlueprint.class );

A Model with a registered Blueprint can then be created by Class:

    modelFactory.createModel(Car.class);

or by passing a Model directly with override values:

    Car car = new Car();
    car.setMake( "Truck" );

    # create a new Model using blueprint defaults, but overriding the Make to be Truck.
    car = modelFactory.createModel(car);

## A Simple Example

### Creating a model

    ModelFactory modelFactory = new ModelFactory();
    modelFactory.registerBlueprint( CarBlueprint.class );
    Car car = modelFactory.createModel(Car.class);

### Creating a model overriding defaults

    Car car = new Car()
    car.setMake( "Caddie" );
    car = modelFactory.createModel(car);

### Car model's Blueprint

    @Blueprint(Car.class)
    public class CarBlueprint {

        @Default
        String make = "car make";

        @Default
        String manufacturer = "car manufacturer";

        @Default
        Integer mileage = 100;

        @Default
        Map status = new HashMap();
    }

### The Car Model

    public class Car {
        private String make;
        private String manufacturer;
        private Integer mileage;
        private Map status;

        public String getMake() {
            return make;
        }

        public void setMake(String make) {
            this.make = make;
        }

        public String getManufacturer() {
            return manufacturer;
        }

        public void setManufacturer(String manufacturer) {
            this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        }

        public Integer getMileage() {
            return mileage;
        }

        public void setMileage(Integer mileage) {
            this.milage = mileage;
        }

        public Map getStatus() {
            return status;
        }

        public void setStatus(Map status) {
            this.status = status;
        }
    }

## Spring Support

There is an optional jar that provides additional support for Spring:


    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.tobedevoured.modelcitizen</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring</artifactId>
      <version>0.8.1</version>
    </dependency>

### Avoiding Spring jar collisions

ModelFactory should work with Spring 3.x, so you can easily exclude ModelFactory's Spring depedency and use the existing one in your pom.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.tobedevoured.modelcitizen</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring</artifactId>
      <version>0.8.1</version>
      <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
    </dependency>

### What does this give me?

This provides a new class [ModelFactoryBean](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/spring/src/main/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/spring/ModelFactoryBean.java) and annotation [@SpringBlueprint](https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen/blob/master/spring/src/main/java/com/tobedevoured/modelcitizen/spring/annotation/SpringBlueprint.java). When the ModelFactoryBean is registered with Spring, it allows the `@SpringBlueprint` and models created by the ModelFactoryBean to be injected by Spring.

#### Example ModelFactoryBean

    <bean id="modelFactory" class="com.tobedevoured.modelcitizen.spring.ModelFactoryBean" >
        <property name="registerBlueprintsByPackage" value="com.tobedevoured.modelcitizen" />
    </bean>

#### Example @SpringBlueprint with Spring support

    @Blueprint(SportsCar.class)
    @SpringBlueprint
    public class SportsCarBlueprint {

        @Autowired
        SportsCarRepository sportsCarRepository;

        @Default
        Integer topSpeed = 100;
    }
